# Screensharing

During an Engagement the Operator might send Visitor a request to share their screen. If the request is approved Visitor's screen will be shared and displayed on the Operator side.

See [explanation video][0]

## Setup

- An iOS device running iOS 11.0+ (on earlier versions no screensharing is possible)
